# Call-Logging-System

## For Siemens Healthcare, Verna-Goa
A web application wherein any valid employee (having a network log in ID) can register an issue. The life of this issue begins on submission of the form. It then passes into the 'processing' stage.  
  
The administrators of the system have the facility to view the list of issues and take appropriate action. Upon resolution it moves to the 'resolved' stage. While all this happens the system provides the registrant with the facility to track the status of his/her issue.  The administrators can also generate a statistical report in a stated interval of time in the form of graphs. This allows him/her to determine which department has faced the most issues and take necessary action to fix it.   
  
Developed using the WAMP stack.
